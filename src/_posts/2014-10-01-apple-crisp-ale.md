Week 2 of the brewing experiment calls for another Fall beer from the [Brooklyn Brew Shop's Beer Making Book](http://brooklynbrewshop.com/beermakingbook): Apple Crisp Ale. I'm not usually one to add adjuncts to my homebrew but--in the interest of learning, experimentation, and the spirit of Fall--apple and cinnamon seemed like a good place to start.

I mash a 1 gallon batch in our [dutch oven](https://www.google.com/search?q=le+creuset+dutch+oven&espv=2&biw=1344&bih=952&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=j8IsVPuWHoOTyQTbxIIo&sqi=2&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg) around 150° and leave it in my oven set at 150° in an attempt to be lazy and not check the temp as often. This can lead to problems however when you've been cooking all evening and the oven hasn't cooled quite as much as you thought it had. Needless to say finding my mash in the 160-165° range twice was frustrating, but I'm fairly confident enough of [the good science](http://www.howtobrew.com/section3/chapter14.html) happened during the mash that this batch won't be a total loss.
