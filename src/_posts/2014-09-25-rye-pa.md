Fall and Rye go together like... a thing and a another thing that goes with that first thing.

Anyway a Rye Pale seemed like a great idea to get back into the swing of things this time of year.

This recipe is derived from a fantiastic book by Erica Shea & Stephen Valand of the [Brooklyn Brew Shop](http://brooklynbrewshop.com) called [Brooklyn Brew Shop's Beer Making Book](http://brooklynbrewshop.com/beermakingbook). I highly recommend their approach to home brewing (1 gallon batches, keep it simple, experiment) and will probably base my first few batches on recipes from that book.
